Scrum,Mainstream,Techniques,FALSE,<p>The default way of working in Emesa is Scrum.</p>
Microservices,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,<p>Build medium-sized specialised services around common functionality or domain context.</p>
Infrastructure as code,Mainstream,Techniques,FALSE,"<p><b>Update Vol.2</b>: We decided to promote this item to ""Mainstream"" from ""Adopt"". This is because we don't have other ways of treating infrastructure it has become our default way of working accross all applications.<br><br>
Although <strong>infrastructure as code</strong> is a relatively old technique, it has become vitally important in the modern cloud era where the act of setting up infrastructure has become the passing of configuration instructions to a cloud platform. When we say ""as code"" we mean that all the good practices we've learned in the software world should be applied to infrastructure. Using source control, adhering to the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself"">DRY principle</a>, modularization, maintainability, and using automated testing and deployment are all critical practices. Those of us with a deep software and infrastructure background need to empathize with and support colleagues who do not. Saying ""treat infrastructure like code"" isn't enough; we need to ensure the hard-won learnings from the software world are also applied consistently throughout the infrastructure realm.</p>"
Hexagonal Architecture,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"<p>Design pattern as a flavour of layered or onion architecture. Used to decouple framework from application code and isolate better Domain, Application and Infrastructure layer. Also a good way to enforce a more DDD approach to projects. Hexagonal Architecture is also known as Ports & Adapters. Used in FFS.</p>"
Architecture decision record (ADR),Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"<p>All new written applications should have an <a href=""https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record"" target=""_blank"">ADR</a> that captures all the relevant architecture decisions made over time.</p>"
DDD,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"<p>With an increasing complex business model inside Emesa we need to design software and systems wisely. Domain Driven Design aims to tackle that complexity with techniques like Ubiquitos Language, Bounded Contexts and Strategic Domain Driven Design. This should lead to software/systems which are loosely coupled and with high cohesion.</p>"
Continuous delivery for machine learning (CD4ML),Mainstream,Techniques,FALSE,"<p><b>Update Vol.2</b>: Promoted to ""Mainstream"" from ""Adopt"". <br><br>
Applying machine learning to make the business applications and services intelligent is more than just training models and serving them. It requires implementing end-to-end and continuously repeatable cycles of training, testing, deploying, monitoring, and operating the models. <strong><a href=""https://martinfowler.com/articles/cd4ml.html"" target=""_blank"">Continuous delivery for machine learning (CD4ML)</a></strong> is a technique that enables reliable end-to-end cycles of development, deploying and monitoring machine learning models. The underpinning technology stack to enable CD4ML includes tooling for accessing and discovering data, version control of artifacts (such as data, model, and code), continuous delivery pipelines, automated environment provisioning for various deployments and experiments, model performance assessment and tracking, and model operational observability. Companies can choose their own toolset depending on their existing tech stack. CD4ML emphasizes automation and removing manual handoffs. CD4ML is our de facto approach for developing ML models.</p>"
Event Storming,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"<p><b>Update Vol.2</b>: Promoted to ""Adopt"" from ""Trial"". Since the previous version of the Radar we used Event Storming succesfully a few times so we can safely say it indeed provides value in our workflows. Even if it it's not used ""by the book"" this technique can give nice insights into domains and discussions can make bounded contexts more obvious.<br><br>
Event Storming is a method of modeling business processes using domain events. With complex business processes, people usually know their part of the process very well. Having people from different departments in one room, allows (and requires!) a conversation. Knowledge silos get opened up. All learnings can be directly visualized. We tried this method a couple of times with different sized scopes. We believe it can be of value and has potential.</p>"
Development Lanes (Strategic/Tech/Fast),Hold,Techniques,FALSE,"<p>Because a team is constantly pulled in this 3 directions: strategic initiatives (business roadmap), technical backlog (constantly fixing technical debt) and operational work an approach would be to clearly separate this work inside a team to avoid distractions in each lane and enable scaling-up/down according to work load. More details can be found <a href=""https://medium.com/teads-engineering/growing-a-feature-team-using-lanes-2e50d5521006"" target=""_blank"">here</a></p><p>It was trialed in Hammer Backend team back in 2019 with decent results and mixed feelings towards it. Was put on hold by the team and never revived again due to capacity issues which didn't meet requirements of a lane: at least 2 devs in 1 lane.</p>"
Common install scripts for every project,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"<p><b>Update Vol.2</b>: Promoted to ""Adopt"" from ""Trial"". <br><br>
We believe in outstanding developer experience. This means it should be easy to spin up a project in local dev environment. That's why each project should have install scripts that take care of getting an application up and running.</p>"
Basic dev documentation in GitHub,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"<p><b>Update Vol.2</b>: Promoted to ""Adopt"" from ""Trial"". <br><br>
Documentation is important. What is more important is that documentation is accessible and up-to-date. That's why technical documentation should live close to the code in Git repository. Non-tech documentation belongs to Confluence.</p>"
Opinionated and automated code formatting,Trial,Techniques,FALSE,"<p><b>Update Vol.2</b>: Promoted to ""Trial"" from ""Assess"". <br><br>
With the introduction of more applications that more teams work on, comes also a variety of coding styles and opinions on how code should look like. We believe plenty of tools bring coding style on par with the industry standards. That's why we want to unify the look and feel for a better DX. One might argue that each team should decide how code should look like but we'd rather have teams talk about what code should do and not how code should look like.</p>"
Container security scanning,Assess,Techniques,FALSE,"<p><b>Update Vol.2</b>: Promoted to ""Adopt"" from ""Assess"". We moved this item dirrectly in Adopt. We're currently scanning all our containers in the pipelines. For now it is set-up in a non-blocking way (releases can continue even in case of warnings). Looking forward we want to see how to incorporate this technique into our way of working.<br><br>
The move of infrastructure from prem to the cloud brings along with the benefits also less control over the security aspects. That's why we want to assess security scanning for containers to bring back some control at the beginning of the pipeline.</p>"
Micro Frontends,Assess,Techniques,FALSE,<p>While our backends are moving to a micro-service architecture our frontend remained pretty monolithical (with all the downsides that brings). That's why we would like to investigate what the Microfrontends technique can do for us so we can make our own opinion if we should pursue this further or not.</p>
Data Mesh,Assess,Techniques,FALSE,"<p><b>Update Vol.2</b>: We didn't have too much progress with the Data Mesh technique since the last edition of the radar. But in the following month we'll be looking into some concepts from this technique and hopefully we'll have a more meaningful update in the next edition.<br><br>
Data Mesh is a technique similar to Microfrontends but applied to the data domain. Data Warehouse and Data Lake patterns are monolithical by nature, while Data Mesh brings the concept of Domain Driven Data (where application teams own the data). Even if this technique is quite yound and for Emesa it might be overkill at this stage we would like to experiment with it to get some real life experience with it.</p>"
Internal apps driven by analytics,Assess,Techniques,FALSE,<p>Best decisions are back-up by data. To support this we want each team to have access to information that tells them how the applications they build are used by our internal users. For this we want to hook every internal application to a self-hosted analytics tool (like Matomo or Plausible).</p>
MariaDB,Mainstream,Platforms-and-Infra,FALSE,<p>Relational database used primarily in PHP projects.</p>
RabbitMQ,Mainstream,Platforms-and-Infra,FALSE,<p>RabbitMQ is one of the most popular open source message brokers. Used for queues on prem.</p>
Kafka,Mainstream,Platforms-and-Infra,FALSE,"<p>Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform used by thousands of companies for high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics, data integration, and mission-critical applications. Kafka is THE message bus to be used inside Emesa for async communication between micro-services.</p>"
AWS,Mainstream,Platforms-and-Infra,FALSE,<p>We use AWS as the default infrastructure hosting for new projects</p>
Apache Airflow,Mainstream,Platforms-and-Infra,FALSE,"<p><strong>Apache Airflow</strong> is a platform created by the community to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows. Use Airflow for On-Prem setups.</p>"
Docker,Mainstream,Platforms-and-Infra,FALSE,"<p><b>Update Vol.2</b>: We decided to promote this item to ""Mainstream"" from ""Adopt"". <br><br>Docker is currently the most-used solution for creating and managing container-based infrastructures and deployments. Backed by services such as Kubernetes, we can deploy Docker containers on a flexible infrastructure and enable our developers to test their software more easily in different environments.</p>"
Kubernetes,Mainstream,Platforms-and-Infra,FALSE,"<p><b>Update Vol.2</b>: We decided to promote this item to ""Mainstream"" from ""Adopt"". <br><br>Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. We use it mostly for newly build micro-services deployed in the cloud.</p>"
PostgreSQL,Mainstream,Platforms-and-Infra,FALSE,<p>Relational database used primarily in data warehousing & ERP/Odoo project.</p>
Redis (cache),Mainstream,Platforms-and-Infra,FALSE,"<p>Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. In Emesa we use it mainly as a  in-memory data structure store.</p>"
AWS DynamoDB,Mainstream,Platforms-and-Infra,FALSE,"<p><b>Update Vol.2</b>: We decided to put DynamoDB ""On Hold"". Several teams confirmed same issues: weird authentication issues, instability and it's quite expensive for the volume of data we use it for. There are other alternatives which we'll use instead, like for example Redis in some cases.<br><br>
Amazon DynamoDB is a key-value and document database. Used in PG project.</p>"
AWS Elasticache Redis,Mainstream,Platforms-and-Infra,FALSE,"<p>Amazon Elasticache Redis is a in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker.</p>"

AWS SQS,Mainstream,Platforms-and-Infra,FALSE,<p>For queues in the cloud.</p>
AWS Lambda,Trial,Platforms-and-Infra,FALSE,"<p><b>Update Vol.2</b>: We'll keep this in Trial for now. It's working well in our data aggregation use cases but on the API side of Feature Storage we still have some doubts. We'll try to use it even more in the future and report the results. <br><br>
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, creating workload-aware cluster scaling logic, maintaining event integrations, or managing runtimes.</p>"
AWS Kinesis,Trial,Platforms-and-Infra,FALSE,"<p><b>Update Vol.2</b>: We didn't use it to it's full potential yet to express a proper opinion.<br><br>
Amazon Kinesis makes it easy to collect, process, and analyze real-time, streaming data so you can get timely insights and react quickly to new information.</p>"
AWS SageMaker,Adopt,Platforms-and-Infra,FALSE,"<p>Amazon SageMaker helps data scientists and developers to prepare, build, train, and deploy high-quality machine learning (ML) models quickly by bringing together a broad set of capabilities purpose-built for ML.</p>"

RedisGraph,Assess,Platforms-and-Infra,FALSE,"<p><a href=""https://redislabs.com/modules/redis-graph/"" target=""_blank"">RedisGraph</a> is based on a unique approach and architecture that translates Cypher queries to matrix operations executed over a GraphBLAS engine. This new design allows use cases like social graph operation, fraud detection, and real-time recommendation to be executed 10x – 600x faster than any other graph database.</p>"
Minikube,Adopt,Platforms-and-Infra,FALSE,<p>Minikube is a tool that lets you run Kubernetes locally. Some teams had good experiences with it which means we can safely recommend this tool for broader use while some people have enough experience with it to help you out if needed.</p>
LXD,Hold,Platforms-and-Infra,FALSE,<p>LXD is a system container manager. It offers a user experience similar to virtual machines but using Linux containers instead. We use LXD for On Prem applications (including dev & test envs). Due to move to cloud we decided to stop using LXD and focus on Docker instead.</p>
Solr,Deprecated,Platforms-and-Infra,FALSE,"<p><b>Update Vol.2</b>: Time has come to Deprecate this technology. We'll remove it completely from out landscape so it will be also out the Radar from future editions.<br><br>
Solr is an indexing platform used by Hammer and AvdD. On Hammer it's used to index lots but it's deprecated and being replaced by Elastic Search. On AvdD it's used to index products.</p>"
Elastic Search,Adopt,Platforms-and-Infra,FALSE,<p>Elastic Search is an indexing platform used by the auctioning platform (Hammer) to index lots and make them available for the auction shops (for listing and search purposes).</p>

Pingdom,Mainstream,Platforms-and-Infra,FALSE,<p>Application monitoring tool.</p>
Apache Webserver,Mainstream,Platforms-and-Infra,FALSE,"<p>For now our go-to webserver for PHP apps is Apache. However, we start looking at NGINX as well so consider that as well if you see performance issues with Apache.</p>"
NGINX,Adopt,Platforms-and-Infra,FALSE,"<p><b>Update Vol.2</b>: Promoted to ""Adopt"" from ""Trial"". <br><br>
By building more PHP apps that are quite high traffic we notice NGINX performing (slightly) better than Apache. That's why we start looking if NGINX might be a better candidate than Apache looking forward.</p>"
Skaffold,Adopt,Platforms-and-Infra,FALSE,"<p><b>Update Vol.2</b>: Promoted to ""Adopt"" from ""Trial"". <br><br>
Skaffold natively supports iterative development for projects configured to use Helm or raw Kubernetes. Some teams had good experience with Skaffold so we can recommend it as a tool for development k8s applications.</p>"
Lighthouse CI,Assess,Platforms-and-Infra,FALSE,"<p>Lighthouse is a free and open-source tool for assessing website’s performance, accessibility, progressive web app metrics, SEO, and more. We want to see if it can bring value if we add it to our CI pipelines.</p>"
AWS Cloudfront,Adopt,Platforms-and-Infra,FALSE,"<p><b>Update Vol.2</b>: Promoted to ""Mainstream"" from ""Adopt"". <br><br></p>"
Kafka Schema Registry,Adopt,Platforms-and-Infra,FALSE,"<p><b>Update Vol.2</b>: Promoted to ""Adopt"" from ""Trial"". We used the Schema Registry succesfull in one of our projects so now we want to roll it out to the rest of our Kafka applications.<br><br>
<p>Schema Registry is a central repository with a RESTful interface for developers to define standard schemas and register applications to enable compatibility. Currently we use AVRO schema to validate our Kafka messages, but started using Schema Registry so we can move to a more Kafka native way of working.</p>"
Kafka REST,Trial,Platforms-and-Infra,FALSE,<p>We are trialing Kafka REST because we want to see if producing and consuming messages in a RESTful way takes away some of the pains of using Kafka protocl (which is not the best in case of PHP).</p>
Redis as main data source,Trial,Platforms-and-Infra,FALSE,"<p><b>Update Vol.2</b>: Promoted to ""Trial"" from ""Assess"".<br><br>

Feature switches platform,Assess,Tools,FALSE,"<p>We want to assess the usage of a platform for feature switches with the purpose to stop rewriting same functionality every time we develop a new application/service. With using such a took we can just plug-and-play and get feature switches fast! We should be careful however to keep implementation as close as possible to the basic if/else of a simple feature toggle (and not slip into overcomplexities of A/B testing, etc).</p>"

Pact,Trial,Tools,FALSE,<p>We recently started doing contract testing and after some POCs we decided that Pact should be the tool to help with that.</p>
Local Stack,Trial,Tools,FALSE,<p>While we start using more AWS componenents in our apps (like S3) developing and testing becomes also a bit more tricky. That's why using Local Stack can prove quite helpful when you want to mock away such services. We used it succesfully in some projects so ask aroud if you need help with it.</p>
Pydantic,Adopt,Tools,FALSE,"<p><b>Update Vol.2</b>: Promoted to ""Adopt"" from ""Assess"".<br><br>

New Relic replacement,Hold,Tools,FALSE,"<p><b>Update Vol.2</b>: We'll stick to New Relic for now.<br><br>
Since the introduction of New Relic quite some time has passed. Without a doubt New Relic has proven a great APM tool that helped us tremendously in the past, but with the introduction of other tools in our landscape like Elastic or Sentry we want to investigate if we can use APM functionality of this tools as alternative to New Relic. For us this will mean simpler application landscape to maintain but also lower costs!</p>"
Amazon Glue,Assess,Tools,TRUE,<p>As we plan to migrate our data warehouse from on prem to AWS we will investigate Amazon Glue as an Airflow alternative in the cloud.</p>
Anmazon Aurora,Assess,Tools,TRUE,<p>Amazon Aurora promises an increase in performance and some other advantages. We will start replacing some MariaDB instances with Aurora and see if it delivers on the promises.</p>
CI/CD Tool Replacement,Assess,Tools,TRUE,<p>As we move to a more Microservice oriented architecture we want to investigate the possibility of decentralising our CI/CD tool. We do this because we want development tools to be in fool control of their release pipelines. Our aim is to also find a tool which is easier to be used by software developers.</p>
SSO Proxy (OAuth2),Assess,Tools,TRUE,<p>Every time we launch a new service we need to  hook it to the SSO platform. We realised this is quite a repetitive and standard activity so we want to investigate the possibility to move this to another layer and make it seamless.</p>
