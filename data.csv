Scrum,Mainstream,Techniques,FALSE,"<p>The default way of working in Emesa is Scrum.</p>"
Microservices,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"<p>Build medium-sized specialised services around common functionality or domain context.</p>"
Infrastructure as code,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"<p>Although <strong>infrastructure as code</strong> is a relatively old technique (weâ€™ve featured it in the Radar in 2011), it has become vitally important in the modern cloud era where the act of setting up infrastructure has become the passing of configuration instructions to a cloud platform. When we say ""as code"" we mean that all the good practices we've learned in the software world should be applied to infrastructure. Using source control, adhering to the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself"">DRY principle</a>, modularization, maintainability, and using automated testing and deployment are all critical practices. Those of us with a deep software and infrastructure background need to empathize with and support colleagues who do not. Saying ""treat infrastructure like code"" isn't enough; we need to ensure the hard-won learnings from the software world are also applied consistently throughout the infrastructure realm.</p>"
Hexagonal Architecture,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"<p>Design pattern as a flavour of layered or onion architecture. Used to decouple framework from application code and isolate better Domain, Application and Infrastructure layer. Also a good way to enforce a more DDD approach to projects. Hexagonal Architecture is also known as Ports & Adapters. Used in FFS.</p>"
Architecture decision record (ADR),Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"<p>All new written applications should have an <a href=""https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record"" target=""_blank"">ADR</a> that captures all the relevant architecture decisions made over time.</p>"
DDD,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"<p>With an increasing complex business model inside Emesa we need to design software and systems wisely. Domain Driven Design aims to tackle that complexity with techniques like Ubiquitos Language, Bounded Contexts and Strategic Domain Driven Design. This should lead to software/systems which are loosely coupled and with high cohesion.</p>"
Continuous delivery for machine learning (CD4ML),Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"<p>Applying machine learning to make the business applications and services intelligent is more than just training models and serving them. It requires implementing end-to-end and continuously repeatable cycles of training, testing, deploying, monitoring, and operating the models. <strong><a href=""https://martinfowler.com/articles/cd4ml.html"" target=""_blank"">Continuous delivery for machine learning (CD4ML)</a></strong> is a technique that enables reliable end-to-end cycles of development, deploying and monitoring machine learning models. The underpinning technology stack to enable CD4ML includes tooling for accessing and discovering data, version control of artifacts (such as data, model, and code), continuous delivery pipelines, automated environment provisioning for various deployments and experiments, model performance assessment and tracking, and model operational observability. Companies can choose their own toolset depending on their existing tech stack. CD4ML emphasizes automation and removing manual handoffs. CD4ML is our de facto approach for developing ML models.</p>"
Event Storming,Trial,Techniques,FALSE,"<p>Event Storming is a method of modeling business processes using domain events. With complex business processes, people usually know their part of the process very well. Having people from different departments in one room, allows (and requires!) a conversation. Knowledge silos get opened up. All learnings can be directly visualized. We tried this method a couple of times with different sized scopes. We believe it can be of value and has potential.</p>"
Development Lanes (Strategic/Tech/Fast),Hold,Techniques,FALSE,"<p>Because a team is constantly pulled in this 3 directions: strategic initiatives (business roadmap), technical backlog (constantly fixing technical debt) and operational work an approach would be to clearly separate this work inside a team to avoid distractions in each lane and enable scaling-up/down according to work load. More details can be found <a href=""https://medium.com/teads-engineering/growing-a-feature-team-using-lanes-2e50d5521006"" target=""_blank"">here</a></p><p>It was trialed in Hammer Backend team back in 2019 with decent results and mixed feelings towards it. Was put on hold by the team and never revived again due to capacity issues which didn't meet requirements of a lane: at least 2 devs in 1 lane.</p>"
Common install scripts for every project,Trial,Techniques,TRUE,"<p>We believe in outstanding developer experience. This means it should be easy to spin up a project in local dev environment. That's why each project should have install scripts that take care of getting an application up and running.</p>"
Basic dev documentation in GitHub,Trial,Techniques,TRUE,"<p>Documentation is important. What is more important is that documentation is accessible and up-to-date. That's why technical documentation should live close to the code in Git repository. Non-tech documentation belongs to Confluence.</p>"
Opinionated and automated code formatting,Assess,Techniques,TRUE,"<p>With the introduction of more applications that more teams work on, comes also a variety of coding styles and opinions on how code should look like. We believe plenty of tools bring coding style on par with the industry standards. That's why we want to unify the look and feel for a better DX. One might argue that each team should decide how code should look like but we'd rather have teams talk about what code should do and not how code should look like.</p>"
Container security scanning,Assess,Techniques,TRUE,"<p>The move of infrastructure from prem to the cloud brings along with the benefits also less control over the security aspects. That's why we want to assess security scanning for containers to bring back some control at the beginning of the pipeline.</p>"
Micro Frontends,Assess,Techniques,TRUE,"<p>While our backends are moving to a micro-service architecture our frontend remained pretty monolithical (with all the downsides that brings). That's why we would like to investigate what the Microfrontends technique can do for us so we can make our own opinion if we should pursue this further or not.</p>"
Data Mesh,Assess,Techniques,TRUE,"<p>Data Mesh is a technique similar to Microfrontends but applied to the data domain. Data Warehouse and Data Lake patterns are monolithical by nature, while Data Mesh brings the concept of Domain Driven Data (where application teams own the data). Even if this technique is quite yound and for Emesa it might be overkill at this stage we would like to experiment with it to get some real life experience with it.</p>"
Internal apps driven by analytics,Assess,Techniques,TRUE,"<p>Best decisions are back-up by data. To support this we want each team to have access to information that tells them how the applications they build are used by our internal users. For this we want to hook every internal application to a self-hosted analytics tool (like Matomo or Plausible).</p>"
MariaDB,Mainstream,Platforms-and-Infra,FALSE,"<p>Relational database used primarily in PHP projects.</p>"

RedisGraph,Assess,Platforms-and-Infra,TRUE,"<p><a href=""https://redislabs.com/modules/redis-graph/"" target=""_blank"">RedisGraph</a> is based on a unique approach and architecture that translates Cypher queries to matrix operations executed over a GraphBLAS engine. This new design allows use cases like social graph operation, fraud detection, and real-time recommendation to be executed 10x â€“ 600x faster than any other graph database.</p>"
Minikube,Adopt,Platforms-and-Infra,FALSE,"<p>Minikube is a tool that lets you run Kubernetes locally. Some teams had good experiences with it which means we can safely recommend this tool for broader use while some people have enough experience with it to help you out if needed.</p>"
LXD,Hold,Platforms-and-Infra,FALSE,"<p>LXD is a system container manager. It offers a user experience similar to virtual machines but using Linux containers instead. We use LXD for On Prem applications (including dev & test envs). Due to move to cloud we decided to stop using LXD and focus on Docker instead.</p>"
